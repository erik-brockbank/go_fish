user_1573681812685,False,I noticed that for those with a pointy bottom helped catch fish than the ones with a circular bottom 
user_1573678265178,False,"I looked in the bottom smaller shapes of the lure to determine my decision. It seem that the shapes that had sharp points caught the fish, and the shape that are round and doesn't have sharp edges didn't catch the fish."
user_1573681828983,True,"The single, best rule I used whether the combinations would catch fish was the bottom half of the combination, if it was similar to successful combinations I used it as an indicator of success for catching fish and vice versa "
user_1573682158469,False,The single best rule I used was if the lure combinations were of a circular main body and triangle attachment.
user_1573664448979,False,"If the lure combination has a pointed bottom, it will catch a fish"
user_1573668338160,True,The lower shape must be a shuriken or a rhombus and the the larger top shape can vary.
user_1573678369310,True,Looking at the shape on the bottom of the lure was the best observation
user_1573678954991,True,presence of 1 purple circle in either of the shapes in the combination
user_1573683140886,False,"Based on the first observation, I know that fish like color red, yellow and spot on the shape. But at first, I am not quite sure about the rule. So i did not apply it. After few more observations, I applied the rule."
user_1573678145931,False,"The bottom part of the lure must have more than 1 side (so a square, a rectangle, a triangle for instance). If it does not, then it cannot catch fish in the lake. "
user_1573664082430,False,"The pattern that I saw the worked for all of the fish included the bottom portion of the lure being a shape that has a defined point, compared to a circle or oval.If the lure had a defined pointed shape, then the lure attracted the fish. "
user_1573678642909,True,I matched up the common colors and shapes of the lures that did work
user_1573668073513,False,"Based on the patterns, the fish will bite when the lure has a larger rounded piece and a smaller pointy piece to resemble a fish body, or when the lure has two pointy pieces. The fish did not bite on the lures with any other combinations."
user_1573668222017,False,"I looked at shape, size, pattern and color of each lure combination and just based my assumptions off of that and what the fishes previously liked or didn't like. "
user_1573668320610,True,Seeing if the shape on top matched with any previous types of successful lures
user_1573682233340,True,whether there is some similarities with the previous ones that could caught the fish
user_1573664238101,True,I could not come up with a rule
